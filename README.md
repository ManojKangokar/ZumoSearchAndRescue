# ZumoSearchAndRescue
ProgrammingThings Assignment

## Set up of the Zumo
- After uploading the ino file, press the A button on the Zumo to begin calibration

## Control 
The Zumo can be controlled using the GUI or any application that has port connection, refer to the Inputs for Zumo section to control the bot.

### GUI 
Features: 
- You can control the Zumo using the buttons or inputs from your keyboard (refer to the Inputs for Zumo)
- Real time Map of the Zumo

## Inputs for Zumo 
- 'm' starts manual control for Zumo
- 'w' Zumo moves forward for 200 milliseconds
- 'a' Zumo moves left for 200 milliseconds
- 's' Zumo moves backwards for 200 milliseconds
- 'd' Zumo moves right for 200 milliseconds
- 'q' Zumo turns 90 degrees to the left
- 'e' Zumo turns 90 degrees to the right
- 'u' Zumo u-turns 180 degrees from the right
- 'y' Zumo u-turns 360 degrees from the right
- 'n' starts autonomous control of the Zumo
- 'g' in autonomous control, Zumo searches the room on its left
- 'h' in autonomous control, Zumo searches the room on its right

## Limitations 
- as this is a physical device things can and will go wrong, sensors and values need to be calabrated
- the distance Zumo travels on the map is fixed, play with the value scale to change the scale if the Zumo goes out of the map
